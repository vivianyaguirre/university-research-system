# Scenario Description:
This data model represents the operational structure of a research organization, focusing on managing projects, researchers, equipment, funding, and collaborations. It tracks the lifecycle of research projects, including researcher roles, equipment usage, funding sources, and collaborations with external institutions, while also maintaining information on publications and datasets generated. Researchers are assigned specific roles, with their contributions tracked over time, and departments oversee projects, managing budgets and resources to ensure effective operations. The system supports grant management by linking projects to funding sources, detailing grant conditions, amounts, and statuses. Collaborative institutions contribute expertise or resources, while equipment usage is logged to ensure maintenance and availability. Publications and datasets are tied to projects, providing a comprehensive view of research outcomes and contributions to the scientific community. This model streamlines research operations, enabling effective resource management, collaboration, and performance monitoring, while offering insights into funding, resource utilization, and research outputs.
# Data Model:
![University RS Model](University-RS-Model.png)

At the heart of the model, the Project entity serves as the central hub, capturing key information such as project titles, budgets, timelines, and departmental oversight. Each project is associated with a specific department via a one-to-many relationship, where a single department can manage multiple projects, but each project is overseen by only one department. Researchers involved in projects are recorded through the Researcher entity, which includes details about their roles, years of experience, and departmental affiliations. A hierarchical structure within the research team is facilitated through a self-referencing "Reports To" relationship. To track the many-to-many relationship between researchers and projects, the Project_has_Researcher table records their roles, contributions, and participation timelines, providing a complete view of personnel allocation and impact.

Funding for projects is managed via the Grants table, which stores information on grant amounts, conditions, and statuses. Each grant is linked to a project through a one-to-many relationship, although a project is not required to have a grant, as indicated by the optional nature of the relationship. Funding sources are independently tracked in the FundingSource table, which records details like the name, type, and total contributions of funders, ensuring clear and transparent funding allocation.

The research outputs generated by projects are captured in the Publication table, which includes details such as publication titles, dates, journals, and citation counts, tying each publication back to its originating project. In addition, the Dataset table manages datasets created or used in research, recording attributes like titles, formats, accessibility levels, and collection dates. This promotes transparency and facilitates data reuse and availability.

Collaboration with external entities is recorded in the CollaboratingInstitution table, which tracks details such as institution names, countries, expertise fields, and partnership dates. These collaborations are linked to projects via the Project_has_CollaboratingInstitution table, a many-to-many relationship table that specifies each institution's role and contribution to a project. This structure ensures effective management of partnerships, enabling the university to leverage external expertise and foster meaningful collaborations.

Overall, the model integrates all aspects of research management, providing a scalable and efficient structure to track projects, personnel, funding, outputs, and collaborations. By leveraging these relationships and modalities, the database ensures comprehensive and transparent oversight of the research process.

### 1. Projects and Departments Relationship: 
Each project is associated with a department, represented by the relationship between the "Project" and "Department" entities. The "Department" entity oversees the projects and manages resources like budgets and locations, ensuring effective project execution.
### 2. Projects and Researchers Relationship:
Researchers are assigned specific roles within projects through the "Project_has_Researcher" entity. This table tracks the researchers' roles, contributions, and the duration of their involvement in each project. Researchers themselves are connected to their departments, enabling tracking of their broader affiliations.
### 3. Projects and Equipment Relationship:
Projects utilize various equipment, and this relationship is captured by the "ProjectEquipment" entity. It connects the "Project" and "Equipment" entities, detailing the start and end dates of equipment usage, as well as its availability and maintenance status.
### 4. Projects and Funding Relationship:
Projects are linked to funding through the "Grants" entity. This table details the grant amount, conditions, status, and the funding source, which is captured in the "FundingSource" entity. This allows the organization to monitor funding sources and their contributions to specific projects.
### 5. Projects and Collaborating Institutions Relationship:
Collaborations with external institutions are tracked using the "Project_has_CollaboratingInstitution" table, which connects the "Project" entity to the "CollaboratingInstitution" entity. This table records the role and nature of the collaboration, such as expertise provided or resources shared.
### 6. Projects and Publications Relationship:
The outcomes of research projects, such as publications, are captured through the "Publication" entity. This table links publications to specific projects and records details like publication titles, dates, journals, and citation counts.
### 7. Projects and Datasets Relationship:
Datasets generated during research activities are connected to projects through the "Dataset" entity. This table stores details about datasets, including titles, formats, accessibility, and collection dates, ensuring a comprehensive record of research outputs.
### 8. Researchers and Reporting Relationship:
The "Researcher" entity includes a self-referential relationship ("Reports To"), allowing the organization to track reporting hierarchies among researchers. This supports effective team management and organizational oversight.
### 9. Equipment Maintenance and Availability:
The "Equipment" entity tracks details such as equipment name, maintenance cost, and availability status, ensuring proper resource management and allocation for ongoing projects.
