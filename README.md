# Scenario Description:
This data model represents the operational structure of a research organization, focusing on managing projects, researchers, equipment, funding, and collaborations. It tracks the lifecycle of research projects, including researcher roles, equipment usage, funding sources, and collaborations with external institutions, while also maintaining information on publications and datasets generated. Researchers are assigned specific roles, with their contributions tracked over time, and departments oversee projects, managing budgets and resources to ensure effective operations. The system supports grant management by linking projects to funding sources, detailing grant conditions, amounts, and statuses. Collaborative institutions contribute expertise or resources, while equipment usage is logged to ensure maintenance and availability. Publications and datasets are tied to projects, providing a comprehensive view of research outcomes and contributions to the scientific community. This model streamlines research operations, enabling effective resource management, collaboration, and performance monitoring, while offering insights into funding, resource utilization, and research outputs.
# Data Model:
This data model represents a relational structure for managing research operations within an organization. It supports the storage and organization of various entities related to projects, researchers, equipment, funding, publications, datasets, and collaborations. Below is a breakdown of how data is structured and the relationships between entities.
### 1. Projects and Departments Relationship: 
Each project is associated with a department, represented by the relationship between the "Project" and "Department" entities. The "Department" entity oversees the projects and manages resources like budgets and locations, ensuring effective project execution.
